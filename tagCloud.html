conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. \
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so \
conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. \
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave \
their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. \
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. \
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \
to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never \
forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work \
which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated \
to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that \
cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these \
dead shall not have died in vain that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and \
that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.";
